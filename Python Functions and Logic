* Using those two functions for ground shipping cost and drone shipping cost, as well as the cost of premium ground shipping, write a function that takes one parameter, weight and prints a statement that tells the user: The shipping method that is cheapest. How much it would cost to ship a package of said weight using this method.

def cheapest_shipping(weight):
  if cost_of_ground_shipping(weight) < cost_of_drone_shipping(weight) and cost_of_ground_shipping(weight) < premium_gound_shipping:
    return "Use ground shipping, it will cost: $" + str(cost_of_ground_shipping(weight))
  elif cost_of_drone_shipping(weight) < cost_of_ground_shipping(weight) and cost_of_drone_shipping(weight) < premium_gound_shipping:
    return "Use drone shipping, it will cost: $" + str(cost_of_drone_shipping(weight))
  else:
      return "Use premium shipping, it will cost: $" + str(premium_gound_shipping)
    

# What is the cheapest method of shipping a 4.8 pound package and how much would it cost?

print(cheapest_shipping(4.8))


What is the cheapest method of shipping a 41.5 pound package and how much would it cost?

print(cheapest_shipping(41.5))
